# Quizzical-App-v2
Version 2 of the Quizzical App - started from scratch due to design problems with first iteration

Project deployed at: https://velvety-mousse-86060f.netlify.app

Description: A really engaging and helpful final solo project from Bob Ziroll's Scrimba Learn Beginner React.js for Free course. 

Consists of a simple trivia 5-question panel of 'medium' difficulty general multiple choice questions. Thankfully, no multiple-multiple choice questions in this dataset.

The data is fetched from the Open Trivia Database API.

Conclusion: Gained a ton of experience with using modern React fundamentals (props, the useState and useEffect React hooks, modern functional component-based React.js app design). Most importantly, learned the hard way that the software design is orders of magnitude more difficult to implement than the actual implementation of the code. 

Total time to project completion is about 10 days, around 7 hours a day on weekends and 1.5 hours a day on weekdays.
